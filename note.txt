What does this endpoint expect?

What does it guarantee in return?

What is optional vs required?

What happens when input is wrong?

You can explain, in words:

What input an endpoint should accept

What output it should return


What a schema actually is in FastAPI

A schema is a Pydantic model.

Conceptually, it is:

A class

With typed fields

That enforces structure at runtime

Example mental model:

schema shapes .. routers attaches the shape to the endpoint


so pydantic enforces the contract, serialize and sanitize
schema shapes the contract 

routes is shape attached to endpoint, this. means when a request is made the endpoint response must be shaped in line with the contract in the schema created by pydantic


from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.routes.user import routing as userRouting

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def server():
    return{"message":"server is running"}

app.include_router(userRouting)

from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    id:int
    name:str
    

    from fastapi import  APIRouter
from app.schema.userschema import UserResponse
from typing import List
from fastapi import Response, status

routing = APIRouter(prefix="/welcome", tags=["USERS"])

@routing.get("/user", response_model=List[UserResponse])
def greet_user():
    return [{ "id":1, "name":"olawale",}]

@routing.post("/user", response_model=UserResponse)
def createUser():
    status_code = status.HTTP_201_CREATED
    return { "id":1, "name":"olawale",}
